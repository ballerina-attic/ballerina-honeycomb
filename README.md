## Integration with Honeycomb

Honeycomb is a tool used to investigate how well your system works in various conditions (for example - high traffic). Through Honeycomb, you can collect data pertaining to your software that can be broken down into various entities. You can observe the performance of each of these entities specifically.
     
> This guide provides instructions on how Ballerina can be used to integrate with Honeycomb.

The following are the sections available in this guide.

- [What you'll build](#what-you’ll-build)
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Implementation](#implementation)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Configuration with Honeycomb](#testing-with-honeycomb)
     - [Traces](#views-of-traces)
     - [Metrics](#metrics)

## What you’ll build
To perform this integration with Honeycomb,  a real world use case of a very simple student management system is used.
This system will illustrate the manipulation of student details in a school/college management system. The administrator will be able to perform the following actions in this service.

    - Add a student's details to the system.
    - List down all the student's details who are registered in the system.
    - Delete a student's details from the system by providing student ID.
    - Generate a mock error (for observability purposes).
    - Get a student's marks list by providing student ID.

![Honeycomb](images/ballerina-honeycomb.svg "Ballerina-Honeycomb")

- **Make Requests** : To perform actions on student management service, a console-based client program has been written in Ballerina for your ease of making requests.

## Prerequisites
 
- [Ballerina Distribution](https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [MySQL](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/ballerina-honeycomb/blob/master/resources/testdb.sql)
- A Text Editor or an IDE 

## Implementation

> If you want to skip the basics, you can download the GitHub repo and continue from the [Testing](#testing) section.

### Implementing the database
 - Start MySQL server in your local machine.
 - Create a database with name `testdb` in your MySQL localhost. If you want to skip the database implementation, then directly import the [testdb.sql](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/ballerina-honeycomb/blob/master/resources/testdb.sql) file into your localhost. You can find it in the GitHub repo.
### Create the project structure
        
 For the purpose of this guide, let's use the following package structure.
        
    
    ballerina-honeycomb
           └── guide
                ├── students
                │   ├── student_management_service.bal
                │   ├── student_marks_management_service.bal
                ├── client_service
                |         └── client_main.bal
                └── ballerina.conf
        

- Create the above directories in your local machine, along with the empty `.bal` files.

- Add the following lines in your [ballerina.conf](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/ballerina-honeycomb/blob/master/ballerina.conf) to send the service traces to Honeycomb in Zipkin format using Opentracing.

```ballerina
[b7a.observability.tracing]
enabled=true
name="zipkin"

[b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin]
reporter.hostname="localhost"
reporter.port=9411

# Here the reporter API is set up in order to send spans. API version v1 is used as the honeycomb-opentracing supports the V1 version.
reporter.api.context="/api/v1/spans"
reporter.api.version="v1"


reporter.compression.enabled=false
```

- Open the terminal, navigate to `ballerina-honeycomb/guide`, and run Ballerina project initializing toolkit.

``
   $ ballerina init
``
- Clone and build the ballerina-zipkin-extension in the following repository [https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-observability/tree/master/tracing-extensions/modules.](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-observability/tree/master/tracing-extensions/modules) 

- After building this extension, navigate to `ballerina-zipkin-extension>/target/distribution/` and copy all the .jar files to your bre/lib folder in your Ballerina distribution.

### Development of student management and marks management services with Honeycomb

Now let us look into the implementation of the student management service with observability.

- Now we have completed the implementation of student management service with marks management service.


## Testing 

### Invoking the student management service

You can start both services by opening a terminal, navigating to `ballerina-honeycomb/guide`, and executing the following command.

```
$ ballerina run --config <path-to-conf>/ballerina.conf students
```

 You need to start the honeycomb-opentracing-proxy. This can be done by using Docker. Docker is used to pull the image for honeycomb-opentracing-proxy.
 Run the following command.
 
 ```
 docker run -p 9411:9411 honeycombio/honeycomb-opentracing-proxy -k APIKEY -d traces
```
- -k represent the API KEY you get when you sign up to your Honeycomb account.

- -d represents the dataset you are going to send your trace data to.

 You can observe the service performance by making some HTTP requests to the above services. This is made easy for you as there is a client program implemented. You can start the client program by opening another terminal and navigating to ballerina-honeycomb/guide
 and run the below command.
 
 ```
 $ ballerina run client_service
 ``` 
### Testing with Honeycomb
 
#### Views of traces
After making HTTP requests, go to [Honeycomb website](https://honeycomb.io) then navigate to your dataset.
When you are in your dataset in Honeycomb UI you get to see a button called `New query`, and when you click on that you can write your own queries on the metrics that you have received.
 
 - You are expected to see the traces as below when you include traceId in the breakdown category.

![Honeycomb](images/traces1.png "Honeycomb")
 
 - To view a particular trace, click on the traceId column, and you will see as below
 
![Honeycomb](images/traces2.png "Honeycomb")
    
 - To view span details with metrics click on a particular span and you are expected to see as below
 
![Honeycomb](images/traces3.png "Honeycomb")
       
#### Metrics 
  You can perform some detailed queries in order to look deep in the performance of your services. Here are some examples:-
  
  - [Total requests](#total-requests)
  - [Resources with high response time](#resources-with-high-response-time)
  - [Counts of database manipulations](#counts-of-database-manipulations)
  - [Mostly hit resources](#mostly-hit-resources)
  - [Average response time](#average-response-time)
  - [Error detection](#error-detection)
  - [Percentiles of response duration](#percentiles-of-response-duration)
  - [Last 1 minute summary](#last-1-minute-summary)
  - [Last 5 minutes summary](#last-5-minutes-summary)
  - [Last 1 hour summary](#last-1-hour-summary)

      3. FILTER - name does-not-start-with ballerina/ 
      4. LIMIT - 100 
      
    We filter out the other default ballerina resource using the filter query.

##### Honeycomb UI Boards
   
   These queries can be predefined and added to the board so that the live observability can be achieved without building queries multiple times. 
   
   To add a query to a board : -
      
   - Create a board.  You can create a board when you run a query. You will see an option “Add to Board” above the query builder.

   -  After creating a board select the board. In this guide a board “Requests details” has been already created. Give a name for your query ,add description to be more clear and save the query

## About Honeycomb
The observability is being achieved by sending traces to the honeycomb UI, in which various queries are executed in order to analyse various conditions where the service is being used by the clients. 
 
 Traces refers to the series of the flow of events that occurs when a request is being made and a response is given back. 

![Honeycomb](images/spans2.png "Honeycomb")

For example a client requesting data from the database as above.
E refers to an event.
A trace is the path from E1 to E4.

Traces are further broken down into spans. 
Spans can be defined as a single operation, i.e server requesting from database to obtain data and receiving it (E2+E3). 
Spans contain data which can be used for interpreting the performance.

These traces contains metadata (span data) which can be captured by honeycomb and be shown graphically or in raw data.

#### Honeycomb open-tracing proxy

Honeycomb works with the data collected in Zipkin format. This proxy will run in your local machine, collects the zipkin formatted trace data and sends to honeycomb.
